# Geological_data_sorting_application
 
My co-developer is studying geology and from time to time they were operating on a machine that took drill samples from the ground. The machine analyzed the sample and wrote the results into a CSV file. The issue was that this file was hard to work with. Users needed information about a few chemical elements at a time, so most of the data was excessive and removing it was tedious. So we built this application where user can select which values (s)he needs (can also specify the range) and produce a file that is much easier to work with.

Please bear in mind that this is the first application we had made thus far learning the basics of Java (and OOP).  And we didn't have much previous coding experience either. If you decide to peek inside the codebase you probably won't find many best practices enforced. You will find some code and a lot of comments written in Estonian because we were highly encouraged to write in Estonian (otherwise we faced some penalties).

# Geological_data_sorting_application
 
My co-developer is studying geology and from time to time they were operating on a machine that took samples from the ground by drilling. The machine analyzed the sample and wrote the results to the CSV file. The issue was that this file was hard to work with because it had too many missing values. Quite often there was a need for information for only a few elements. So we built this application where you can select which values you need (also specify the range) and produce a file that is much easier to work with.

Please bear in mind that this is the first application we had made thus far learning the basics of Java (and OOP).  And we didn't have much previous coding experience either. If you decide to peek inside the codebase you probably won't find many best practices enforced. You will find some code and a lot of comments written in Estonian because we were highly encouraged to write in Estonian (otherwise we faced some penalties).
